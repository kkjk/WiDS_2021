# WiDS_2021
Kaggle compettition held as part of Women in Data Science 2021 conference. The challenge was `Identifying Diabetes Condition to provide better care for ICU patients`

## Overview
Overview

The challenge focused on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, `Diabetes Mellitus`.
Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, individuals and teams will explore labeled training data for model development. 
Participants will then upload predictions for unlabeled data to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final leaderboard revealed at the close of the competition.

## Evaluation Metric

Submissions for the leaderboard were evaluated on the 
`Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)` curve between the predicted and the observed target (diabetes_mellitus_diagnosis).

## Data Analysis

Libraries used:  `Pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
